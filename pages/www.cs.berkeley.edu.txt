 My links 
 I run the Berkeley Programming Contest. 
     It typically runs in late September. 
  Discussion on security that I started
after listening to various incompetent blather about the Love Bug virus 
on the Newshour with Jim Lehrer.  I also have a draft of my own
flame on the subject.
 Assorted Files for Distribution.
  Home page for Ada Core Technologies, where
you will find the best Ada 05 compiler available (a version of GCC), as well
as an Ada-aware version of GDB, the GNU debugger.
 The Titanium project.
 A collection of quotations and such from 
     plan files and other sources.
 A collection of extra-credit problems 
from my tests.
 Assorted Software 
 PRCS: The Project
Revision Control System.  This is a really great improvement on
CVS for source-code control.
 GJDB: A Java debugger for Sun's JDK 1.3, 
adjusted to be Emacs-compatible and to allow input from stdin.
 ucb package: A package of Java 
     classes providing C and C++-like I/O (Java-ized versions of
     printf, scanf, &amp;lt&amp;lt, and &amp;gt&amp;gt).  
     HTML documentation
     also available.
 Description of mprof (also in a
     Postscript version),

     latest version.
